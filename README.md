Functionalities:
- employee login (can be used by multiple tourism agencies and their employees)
- view flights
- filter flights
- buy tickets for clients
Non-functional requirements:
- server + client in Java (the server is also compatible with C# clients - see the repository for that app)
- distributed observer pattern
- JavaFX for GUI
- the communication protocol is string based, made by me
